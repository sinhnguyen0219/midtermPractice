CS 310 Midterm Exam Practice
============================
If this were a real exam, it would be worth 15 points. 
It has 5 
"questions", each represented by a unit test. 
The first 3 questions have 
their unit tests fully specified, 
and you must implement the Hangman 
class methods to ensure that those tests pass correctly. 
The final 2 
questions only have meaningful unit test names. 
You must create the
unit tests to satisfy the names and then implement the Hangman class 
methods so that those tests pass correctly.


If it is not clear yet, the goal of this code is to create a working
Hangman game.
